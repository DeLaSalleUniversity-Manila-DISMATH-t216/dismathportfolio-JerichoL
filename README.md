# Week 1
- I was introduced to a really interesting but rather weeeiiirrddd topic based on mathematics called Discrete Mathermatics (DISMATH)
- I understood what the basics of Discrete Mathematics was all about; **Proof**, **Proposition**, **Logical Deduction**, and **Axioms**
- That there are several *truths* as dependent to its beholder: **Legal Truth**, **Authorative Truth**, **Scientific Truth**, **Probable Truth**, and **Philosophical Truth**. But sadly we wouldn't tackle these types of truth which I wanted to know.
- **LOGICAL CONNECTIVES:**

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Shorthand | Formula | Logical Expression |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: | :-------: |
| ¬ |Negation | not | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p) | ¬p |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q)) | p ∧ q |
| v | Disjunction | or | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q)) | p v q |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor | if val(p)  not equal val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0|  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |
| → | Conditional | if, then | if val(p)  ≤ val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0  | p → q ≡  ¬p v q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0 |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |
